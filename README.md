# Udacity-AB-test

Project overview

In this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment.
